Always passionate about photography, I have decided to do a mockup page to display pictures from my trip to South Korea in 2018:

- Using Next JS framework and Tailwind CSS 
- Promoting the advantages of both frameworks
- Easy setup for Tailwind CSS in Next JS environment
- Modern-looking web pages

## Credits

- [Next.js/Vercel Team](https://nextjs.org/), for a forwarded looking react framework that build to-production apps quickly, and hosting Next.js apps for free and easily on Vercel

- [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons), providing awesome fonts and icons from various sources

## Features

NextJs features used:
- page routing, using folders to enable routing
- Image component by next/head, which allows optimisation of pictures (size and lazy loading)
- api routes, to send customer details to mongo database

Tailwind CSS:
- basic utilities to set size, margins/paddings quickly
- flex and grid utilities to provide clean organisation of components
- hover:, active: utitlies to help with user interaction with components
- provide an overall unique page look (as opposed to other component based CSS frameworks)
